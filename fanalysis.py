    - Increased market share
    - Effective pricing strategies
    - Overall business health and potential for future growth

    Profitability ratios are crucial metrics that reveal a company's ability to generate profit relative to its revenue, assets, or equity. We focus on three key ratios:

    - Indicates the efficiency of the production process and pricing strategy
    
    2. Operating Income Ratio: Operating Income / Revenue
    - Reflects the company's profitability from its core business operations
    
    3. Net Income Ratio: Net Income / Revenue

    Return on Equity (ROE) is a key profitability metric that measures how effectively a company uses its shareholders' equity to generate profits. It's calculated as:

    ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity

    A higher ROE suggests that a company is more efficient at using its equity to create profits. In the tech sector, ROE can vary widely due to factors like:

    - Capital intensity of the business model
    - Stage of company growth
    - Dividend policies and stock buybacks

    When analyzing ROE, consider it alongside other metrics and the company's overall strategy.

    2. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: Critical for tech companies to stay competitive
